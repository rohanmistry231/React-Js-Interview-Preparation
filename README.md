## 💡 Why Master React.js for Front-End Development?

React.js is the industry standard for building interactive UIs, and here’s why:
1. **Component-Based**: Simplifies building reusable, modular UIs.
2. **Rich Ecosystem**: Integrates with tools like Redux, React Router, and more.
3. **Performance**: Virtual DOM ensures fast rendering.
4. **Industry Demand**: A must-have skill for 6 LPA+ front-end roles.
5. **Community Support**: Backed by a massive developer network.

This repo is my roadmap to mastering React.js for technical interviews and front-end careers—let’s build that skill set together!

## 📆 Study Plan

- **Week 1-2**: Core React Fundamentals and Hooks
- **Week 3-4**: State Management, Routing, and APIs
